                Tableau was in need of a fresh visual identity, contrasting with their current one. The goal was to create a more intuitive website, significantly improving navigation and filtering capabilities for their extensive range of unique
                products. This project served as our second-semester exam at KEA and was a collaborative effort with three other skilled students. We approached Tableau as a typical client, maintaining constant communication with them to ensure the
                new visual identity aligned seamlessly with their vision for Tableau.
              </p>
              <p>
                My primary roles on the project revolved around implementing and testing for the new website. I utilized the Astro framework tool to develop components that maintained a consistent structure throughout the website. Additionally, we
                integrated the Supabase database system, enabling the client to effortlessly upload their product details.

                Omada Wine and Deli sought a conceptual design for their newly opened deli store in Copenhagen. It was essential that the visual identity harmonized with their existing color scheme, characterized by their distinctive red in
                combination with white. Given that the website's primary purpose wasn't online sales but rather to highlight the essence of the store and its numerous events, we developed a one-page design. This design placed focus on their unique
                "plat du jour" concept, wine tastings, and exclusive products.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the project, my main responsibilities was centered on the coding aspects of the website and its functionalities. This included the development of features like the Plat du Jour suggestion section and the product slider. The primary
                focus for the page was on responsive web design, allowing for seamless viewing across all platforms. Furthermore, we produced promotional marketing videos, one of which is displayed in the top hero section of the page.

                "Coffee First" was my initial client project, involving a complete redesign of the website for a dog-friendly coffee café. The website consists of three pages, with the primary page being the homepage, where customers can conveniently
                access essential information such as opening hours, location details, and the menu, all thoughtfully combined onto a single page. We wished to create an elegant design, using their main beige color scheme with a refreshing splash of
                green. What makes this project especially significant is that the client opted to independently implement the design onto their existing website.
              </p>
              <p>
                My primary role centered on the coding and implementation of the website, given that I was the lead website developer for the project. The site was constructed using a grid structure primarily featuring two columns, mirroring a menu
                card layout. To encapsulate the essence of the café, we crafted a promotional video, which is found on the "About Us" page.
